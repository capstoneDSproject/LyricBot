# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT 

- [ ] **Project Summary**

Creating lyrics is not at all a simple task, because it requires not only a clear understanding of natural language processing, but also a knowledge of songwriting techniques. Some people find it hard to create a song or lyric because they don't know how the flow of a song should be. So the system helps give the user an idea to create their own lyrics based on the genre they choose.
